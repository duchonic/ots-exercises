# Matching brackets

Given a string determine if the brackets are correctly matching.

- You can start with a string with only one type of brackets (`(`).
- You can then conitnue with strings only containing the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']',
- Finally, you can try to allow any character and check that the brackets contained are matching.

A string has matching brackets if:

- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
- Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
