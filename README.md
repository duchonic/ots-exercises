# 30-min-exercises

30 minute long exercises for the OpenTechSchool Co-Learning in Zurich

Some sources for simple exercises:

- <https://rosettacode.org/>
- <https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/>

With online participants we are using:

- <https://syncfiddle.net/>, a collaborative platform for Javascript.

We need to try

- <https://sharepad.io/> (is not free but seem to be what we need)

We would prefer to use Python and we are searching a platform:

- We can use for free.
- Where participants do not need register (the organiser might need to register).
- Allows the participants to edit the code collaboratively.
- Allows to run the code.

Collaborative editor that cannot run code:

- <https://rustpad.io>
